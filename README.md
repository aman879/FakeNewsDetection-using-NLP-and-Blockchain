# Fake News Detection using NLP and Blockchain
## 📖 Introduction
In the digital age, misinformation and fake news are pervasive issues. This project aims to tackle these problems using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for fake news detection and Blockchain technology to ensure the integrity and verification of news content.
## 🪶 Features
- 🤝**Smart Contract Implementation:** Secure and efficient smart contracts written in Solidity to handle news submissions, voting, and verification.
- 🕸️**Decentralized Voting System:** Allows verifiers to vote on the authenticity of news articles, ensuring a transparent and democratic verification process.
- 🔮**Real-Time Prediction:** Offers real-time prediction and verification of news authenticity using a combination of machine learning models and blockchain validation.
- 🔐**Secure and Transparent:** Ensures that all transactions and verifications are secure and transparent, leveraging the decentralized nature of blockchain technology.
## 🔖 Tech Stack
**Client:** React, Tachyons, Axios

**Server:** Node, Express, Solidity, Hardhat
